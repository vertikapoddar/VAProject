However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.\r\nIn January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\nOur aim is to decode this mystery.\r\nFor this our storyboard is as follows:\r\nStoryboard 1Storyboard 2Storyboard 3\r\n\r\n\r\n",
